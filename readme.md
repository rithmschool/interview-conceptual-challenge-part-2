## Questions

1.  What is HTTP?
- HyperText Transfer Protocol is the foundation of any data exchange of data on the web. It was designed to serve as a bridge for communication between web browser and web servers. It fetches HTML documents, sends requests.

2.  What is the difference between GET and POST?
- GET is a request you send to the server from the client side when you want to retrieve information but not modify it in anyway. READ.
POST is a request to modify, or create information on the server side.

3.  What is REST?
- REST is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. It is also a style for providing conventions between engineers who write the code.

4.  What is DNS?
- Domain Name System translates and stores domain names to IP addresses. It is a mapping

5.  What is AJAX? (Asynchrous javascript and xml)
- Ajax is the use of XMLHttpRequest to communicate with web servers using asynchrous javascript code. Sends requests to the web server.

6.  What is the Same Origin Policy?
- This policy forbids cross-origin sharing. Data can only be shared within the same domain.

7.  What is CORS?
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing is a system of consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determine whether to block or fulfill requests for data on a web page from another domain outside the domain from which the data originated.

8.  What is responsive design?
- Responsive design is all about making sure the design of your website looks good on all devices. It scales properly between different screen sizes.

9.  What does "use strict" do in JavaScript?
10. What are data- attributes good for?

11. Describe the differences between cookies, sessionStorage and localStorage
- Cookies are what you store in sessionStorage or localStorage to authenticate a user. sessionStorage is for data/information that you want the browser to store

12. What is an HTTP header? List some examples of headers you've used.
An HTTP header allow for extra information to be passed from the web browser to the web server in the request/response cycle.
Authorization
Content-type
Location

13. What is Cross Site Scripting or XSS?
 XSS is a security vulnerability found in web apps. It enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to authenticate themselves or bypass same-origin policy.

14. What is SQL Injection?
SQL injection is a security vulneranility used to attack data-driven applications by injecting code onto the backend.

15. What is Cross Site Request Forgery or CSRF?
- CSRF happens when a site's security is weak and is left open for hackers. Specifically it is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application where they're currently authenticated (signed in). Matt used this attack to steal our Rithm coins.

16. What is Long polling?

17. What would happen if you inserted a sorted list into a binary search tree? How can you avoid this problem?
It would be a one sided tree since they'd all be bigger or smaller than the root.

18. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a linked list over an array?
- The advantages of using a linkedlist over an array come about when we want to extract or inject a node from the list. We just need too reassign the previous node's next and the next node's previous. WIth an array we have to reassign each val and their index.
Disadvantage is we always have to go through the entire list.

19. What interests you about web development?
- To me, web development is the ability to create and build products that will ultimately have an impact on someone's life. There's a never ending learning curve and plenty of opportunities to work for different and interesting companies, which is exciting.
20. Tell me about your background.
