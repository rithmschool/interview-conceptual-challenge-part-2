* I graduated UC Irvine with a BA in Film & Media Studies and Minor in Digital Arts, and have successfully completed a four month full stack engineering accelerator at Rithm. Most recently I was contracted to a team at Groupmuse to delvelop their first iOS application. I bring with me a wide variety of work epxperience--DreamWorks Animation, fitness and nutrition personal trainer, EMT and firefighter intern--illustrating my ability to adapt and succeed in new and stressful situations tackling challenging and potentially unforseen problems. I have excellent written and oral communication skills, able to bridge the divide between interpersonaly work relations and technical conversation, and I have a passion for software development. I have been studying and working near 12 hours most days for four months building my skills in _insert relevant language/framework_ and before this worked and interned 70+ hours per week on an abulance and fire engine. I can promise a strong and consistent work ethic, a passion for learning, implementing, and improving, and a team-player who values honesty, support, and progress. At Jesuit High School Sacramento, I was taught to be a "Man for Others", an ideal by which I continue to challenge myself to live personally and professionally.
